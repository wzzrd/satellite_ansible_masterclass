# Demo scripts from the Red Hat Benelux Satellite / Ansible masterclass

Every couple of monthts, Fred van Zwieten and Maxim Burgerhout (solution
architects at Red Hat Benelux) teach a masterclass around Red Hat Satellite
server and Ansible Tower by Red Hat.

This masterclass is about more complex functionality in both products,
integration between them, and automating certain aspects of them by using CLI
and API scripts.

At the request of various attendees of earlier masterclasses, we are now
publishing the scripts we use during for the masterclass demos on Github, so
everyone can take a look.

If you have ideas on improving these, just send us a pull request ;)
